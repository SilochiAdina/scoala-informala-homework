/**
 * You need to design an application that allows the possibility to calculate the surface and perimeter for multiple
 * types of shape: rectangle, square, circle and triangle.
 * The tool should allow the possibility to add multiple shapes and calculate the total sum for perimeter and for surface.
 * Also, the application should make sure that 2 similar shapes couldnâ€™t be added to the drawing tool.
 * In case 2 similar shapes are added, an appropriate message should be printed to console.
 * Since you want to be sure that you provide a high quality implementation, simulations are needed to
 * prove the main functionalities described above, work correctly (add all types of shapes, add duplicates,
 * add single shape and pairs of shapes).
 * To deliver the work, just make a zip file and attached it to the answer.
